# Read-and-write-from-.json-file
An example use of JSON java library (https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java).

This program was build and tested with OpenJDK 11.0.3.7.
It allows to read .json file stored in /bin/files/ directory, with a constant filename 'example.json'.
The other utility is to edit the loaded content and optionally overwrite .json file so the changes could be kept.
